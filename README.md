This is my Tutedude python assignment
<br>
This repository contains Python scripts created as part of an assignment.

## Task 1
**File:** task1.py  

**Description:**  
This program takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Task 2
**File:** task2.py  

**Description:**  
This program asks the user for their first name and last name and then displays a greeting message.

## Project
**File:** project.py
**Description**
This Python program is a menu-driven Employee Management System that allows users to add, view, and search employee records using a dictionary-based data structure through a terminal interface with emoji-enhanced prompts.
Employee information such as Employee ID, Name, Age, Department, and Salary is stored in a nested Python dictionary, where each employee ID acts as a unique key. The system ensures that duplicate employee IDs are not allowed.
⚠️ Caution: All data is stored temporarily in memory and will be lost once the program exits. The program assumes valid user input; entering non-numeric values for ID, age, or salary may cause runtime errors. Additionally, no validation is applied for negative or unrealistic values, and the system is intended only for learning and demonstration purposes, not for real-world or production use.
